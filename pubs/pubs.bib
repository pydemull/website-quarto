  abstract = {Background: Ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest is the main clinical tool to diagnose the presence of lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). The method for ABI procedure (i.e., measurement, calculation and interpretation) is standardised and guidelines were published in 2012. This study sought to: i) assess knowledge about the three major steps of the ABI procedure (i.e., measurement, calculation and interpretation) among residents from different medical schools, ii) compare the ABI knowledge of experienced residents (i.e., who have already performed ABI procedure more than 20 times) with the knowledge of inexperienced residents, and iii) describe the most common errors by residents. Methods: Residents from six medical schools were invited to complete a questionnaire about the ABI procedure. Results: Sixty-eight residents completed the questionnaire. None of them knew how to perform the entire ABI procedure. Overall, 22\,\%, 13\,\% and 41\,\% of residents correctly answered questions about ABI measurement, ABI calculation and ABI interpretation, respectively. Score comparisons underlined the fact that experienced residents (n\,=\,26) answered ABI measurement questions to a significantly better level and had a significantly higher total score than inexperienced residents (n\,=\,42) (P\,=\,0.0485 and P\,=\,0.0332, respectively). Errors were similar for most of the residents. Conclusions: Our study confirms that experienced residents have significantly better ABI procedure knowledge than inexperienced residents. However, none of them are able to perform the entire ABI procedure without any mistake with regard to current guidelines. It is important that training be given to residents in medical schools in order to improve their ABI procedure knowledge.},

  abstract = {Objective: To conduct a systematic review focusing on the impact of training programs on ankle-brachial index (ABI) performance by medical students, doctors and primary care providers. Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent disease affecting w202 million people worldwide. ABI is an essential component of medical education because of its ability to diagnose PAD, and as it is a powerful prognostic marker for overall and cardiovascular related mortality. Methods: A systematic search was conducted (up to May 2015) using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Results: Five studies have addressed the impact of a training program on ABI performance by either medical students, doctors or primary care providers. All were assigned a low GRADE system quality. The components of the training vary greatly either in substance (what was taught) or in form (duration of the training, and type of support which was used). No consistency was found in the outcome measures. Conclusion: According to this systematic review, only few studies, with a low quality rating, have addressed which training program should be performed to provide the best way of teaching how to perform ABI. Future high quality researches are required to define objectively the best training program to facilitate ABI teaching and learning.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To develop, assess the feasibility of, and determine the clinical validity of an event‐based analysis method using wearable monitors to quantify walking pain manifestations (WPMs) and stops induced by walking pain (SIWPs) during daily life walking in people with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Methods: The following two conditions were studied: a standardized outdoor walking session (OWS) and a seven‐day free‐living measurement (FLM) period. The PAD participants (n = 23) wore an accelerometer and a watch. They were asked to press the event marker button on the watch to indicate events related to WPMs and SIWPs. To assess the clinical validity of the method, the computed pain‐free walking time (PFWT) and maximal walking time (MWT) were compared with the PFWT and MWT assessed using standard treadmill walking protocols, respectively. Results: Following OWSs, the PFWT[OWS] and MWT[OWS] were significantly correlated with the PFWT[Strandness] (r = .955, P {$<$} .001) and MWT[Strandness] (r = .821, P {$<$} .001), respectively. During the FLM, PAD participants experienced only 2 WPMs/day and 1 SIWP/day, although severely limited on the treadmill and during the OWS. The average WPMs/day were moderately correlated with the PFWT[Strandness] (r = −.54, P = .016). The PFWT[FLM] was on average 12 times longer than the PFWT[Strandness]. Interestingly, the intensity of the walking bouts as assessed by the accelerometer counts during the FLM was significantly lower than that during the OWS (45 ± 15 vs 66 ± 20 counts/s, P {$<$} .001). Conclusion: This new method offers opportunities for studies investigating the experience of living with PAD and the assessment of daily life walking capacity for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.},

  abstract = {We aimed at showing how Global Positioning System (GPS) along with a previously validated speed processing methodology could be used to measure outdoor walking capacities in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). We also deal with methodological issues that may occur when conducting such measurements, and explore to what extent GPS-measured outdoor walking capacities (maximal walking distance [MWDGPS] and usual walking speed) could be related to traditional functional outcomes (6-min total walking distance) in people with MS. Eighteen people with MS, with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score ≤6, completed a 6-min walking test and an outdoor walking session (60 min maximum) at usual pace during which participants were wearing a DG100 GPS receiver and could perform several walking bouts. Among the 12 participants with valid data (i.e., who correctly completed the outdoor session with no spurious GPS signals that could prevent the detection of the occurrence of a walking/stopping bout), the median (90\% confidence interval, CI) outdoor walking speed was 2.52 km/h (2.17; 2.93). Ten participants (83\% (56; 97)) had ≥1 stop during the session. Among these participants, the median of MWDGPS was 410 m (226; 1350), and 40\% (15; 70) did not reach their MWDGPS during the first walking bout. Spearman correlations of MWDGPS and walking speed with 6-min total walking distance were, respectively, 0.19 (−0.41; 0.95) and 0.66 (0.30; 1.00). Further work is required to provide guidance about GPS assessment in people with MS.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of using speed and grade data obtained from a low-cost global positioning system (GPS) receiver to estimate metabolic rate (MR) during level and uphill outdoor walking. Thirty young, healthy adults performed randomized outdoor walking for 6-min periods at 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 km/h and on three different grades: 1) level walking, 2) uphill walking on a 3.7\% mean grade, and 3) uphill walking on a 10.8\% mean grade. The reference MR [metabolic equivalents (METs) and oxygen uptake (V̇o               2               )] values were obtained using a portable metabolic system. The speed and grade were obtained using a low-cost GPS receiver (1-Hz recording). The GPS grade (Δ altitude/distance walked) was calculated using both uncorrected GPS altitude data and GPS altitude data corrected with map projection software. The accuracy of predictions using reference speed and grade (actual               [SPEED/GRADE]               ) data was high [ R               2               = 0.85, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.68 MET]. The accuracy decreased when GPS speed and uncorrected grade (GPS               [UNCORRECTED]               ) data were used, although it remained substantial ( R               2               = 0.66, RMSE = 1.00 MET). The accuracy was greatly improved when the GPS speed and corrected grade (GPS               [CORRECTED]               ) data were used ( R               2               = 0.82, RMSE = 0.79 MET). Published predictive equations for walking MR were also cross-validated using actual or GPS speed and grade data when appropriate. The prediction accuracy was very close when either actual               [SPEED/GRADE]               values or GPS               [CORRECTED]               values (for level and uphill combined) or GPS speed values (for level walking only) were used. These results offer promising research and clinical applications related to the assessment of energy expenditure during free-living walking.},

This study revealed that a median work-to-rest ratio {$>$}1:1 leads to the resumption of walking with unrecovered ischemia and precludes the restoration of full walking capacity, whereas a work-to-rest ratio ≤1:2 allowed walking capacity to fully be restored.           ,                             The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of recovery time on walking capacity (WC) throughout repeated maximal walking bouts in symptomatic lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). The effect of recovery time on WC (maximal walking time) was determined in 21 participants with PAD in three experimental conditions [recovery time from 0.5 to 9.5\,min + a self-selected recovery time (SSRT)]: 1) 11 repeated sequences of two treadmill walking bouts (TW-ISO); 2) a single sequence of seven treadmill walking bouts (TW-CONS); 3) a single sequence of seven outdoor walking bouts (OW-CONS). Exercise transcutaneous oxygen pressure changes were continuously recorded as an indirect measure of ischemia. An individual recovery time (IRT) beyond which WC did not substantially increased was determined in participants with a logarithmic fit. At the group level, mixed models showed a significant effect ( P {$<$} 0.001) of recovery time on WC restoration. At the participant level, strong logarithmic relationships were found (median significant R               2               ≥ 0.78). The median SSRT corresponded to a median work-to-rest ratio {$>$}1:1 (i.e., a lower recovery time in view of the corresponding previous walking time) and was related to unrecovered ischemia and a WC restoration level of {$<$}80\%. A median work-to-rest ratio of ≤1:2 allowed full recovery of ischemia and full restoration of WC. The IRT ratio was between 1:1 and 1:2 and corresponded to the start of recovery from ischemia. Recovery time affects the restoration level of WC during repeated maximal walking bouts in symptomatic PAD. Meaningful variations in WC restoration were related to specific levels of work-to-rest ratios.

  abstract = {Objectives: To determine the best method and combination of methods among global positioning system (GPS), accelerometry, and heart rate (HR) for estimating energy expenditure (EE) during level and graded outdoor walking. Design: Thirty adults completed 6-min outdoor walks at speeds of 2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 km h−1 during three randomized outdoor walking sessions: one level walking session and two graded (uphill and downhill) walking sessions on a 3.4\% and a 10.4\% grade. EE was measured using a portable metabolic system (K4b2). Participants wore a GlobalSat® DG100 GPS receiver, an ActiGraphTM wGT3X+ accelerometer, and a Polar® HR monitor. Linear mixed models (LMMs) were tested for EE predictions based on GPS speed and grade, accelerometer counts or HR-related parameters (alone and combined). Root-mean-square error (RMSE) was used to determine the accuracy of the models. Published speed/grade-, count-, and HR-based equations were also cross-validated. Results: According to the LMMs, GPS was as accurate as accelerometry (RMSE = 0.89–0.90 kcal min−1) and more accurate than HR (RMSE = 1.20 kcal min−1) for estimating EE during level walking; GPS was the most accurate method for estimating EE during both level and uphill (RMSE = 1.34 kcal min−1)/downhill (RMSE = 0.84 kcal min−1) walking; combining methods did not increase the accuracy reached using GPS (or accelerometry for level walking). The cross-validation results were in accordance with the LMMs, except for downhill walking. Conclusions: Our study provides useful information regarding the best method(s) for estimating EE with appropriate equations during level and graded outdoor walking. © 2017 Sports Medicine Australia.

  abstract = {The authors investigated the agreement between StepWatch3™ (SW3) and ActiGraph™ wGT3X+ monitors for measuring step-based metrics in patients with peripheral artery disease and older adults. In 23 patients with peripheral artery disease and 38 older participants, the authors compared the metrics obtained during an outdoor (400-m track) walking session (step count) and a 7-day free-living period (step count and 60/30/5/1-min maximal or peak step accumulation) using the SW3 (ankle) and the wGT3X+ (hip) with the low-frequency extension filter enabled (wGT3X+/LFE) or not (wGT3X+/N). During outdoor walking session, agreement was high, particularly for wGT3X+/LFE: correlations ≥.98, median absolute percentage errors {$<$}1\%, and significant equivalence using a\,±\,15\% equivalence zone or narrower. In free living, no wGT3X+ method was equivalent to SW3 for step count. The wGT3X+/LFE was equivalent to SW3 regarding all step accumulation metrics using a\,±\,20\% equivalence zone or narrower, with median absolute percentage errors {$<$}11\%. The wGT3X+/LFE method is the best option for comparisons with SW3 in peripheral artery disease and older adults.}
