<p>I'm Pierre-Yves de MÃ¼llenheim, an assistant professor at the Institute of Physical Education and Sport Sciences in Angers, France. My research focuses on developing and implementing wearable device-based methods to measure physical activity and walking capacity, especially in patients with chronic diseases and mobility impairments. Additionally, I am interested in developing and utilizing open-source algorithms and web applications to analyze data from wearable devices, with a particular emphasis on using the R programming language.</p>
