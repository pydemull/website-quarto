<p>

I'm Pierre-Yves de MÃ¼llenheim, an associate professor at the Institute of Physical Education and Sport Sciences of Angers (France). My research works relate to the development and application of wearable device-based methods for measuring physical behaviour and walking capacity in humans, preferentially in patients with chronic disease(s) and walking limitations. In a complementary manner, I'm also interested in the development and use of open-source algorithms and web applications to facilitate the analysis of data from wearable devices, in particular using R programming language.
